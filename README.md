# Adler Barroso Ferreira
<sub>*Insurance Renewal Assistant* at Sicoob Corretora </sub>

My strongest experience in the market came from the investment and insurance areas. I spent some time analyzing investment products such as stock prices, structured notes, funds, fixed income, and economic indices for good portfolio management.

In my tasks, I always enjoyed analyzing data and its behaviors. I built Excel spreadsheets with various formulas for this purpose, and when I realized it, I noticed that my passion was in data analysis. At this turning point, I became interested in a career as a data scientist and began studying Python focused on data science. That's where I found the Data Science na Prática course at Sigmoidal, the portal of the illustrious Professor Carlos Melo.

Further down, I will segment the projects developed during my studies in this course.
